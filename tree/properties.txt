Number of edges: An edge can be defined as the connection between two nodes. If a tree has N nodes then it will have (N-1) edges. There is only one path from each node to any other node of the tree.

Depth of a node: The depth of a node is defined as the length of the path from the root to that node. Each edge adds 1 unit of length to the path. So, it can also be defined as the number of edges in the path from the root of the tree to the node.

Height of a node: The height of a node can be defined as the length of the longest path from the node to a leaf node of the tree.

Height of the Tree: The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root of the tree to a leaf node of the tree.

Degree of a Node: The total count of subtrees attached to that node is called the degree of the node. The degree of a leaf node must be 0. The degree of a tree is the maximum degree of a node among all the nodes in the tree.

# Traversing in a tree is done by depth first search and breadth first search algorithm.
    # Breadth first search : level order traversal
    # Depth first search : inoder, preorder, postorder

# It has no loop and no circuit.

# It has no self-loop.

# Its hierarchical model.
