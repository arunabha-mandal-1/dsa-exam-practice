Binary search tree:
    A BST is a binary tree which is either empty or in which the following are satisfied -
        1. All keys of the left subtree of the root are less than the key in the root
        2. All keys of the right subtree of the root are greater than the key in the root
        3. The left subtrees and the right subtrees of a BST are BST once again.



Why can you not have duplicate entries in a BST?
---------------------------------------------------
    In a Binary Search Tree (BST), all keys in left subtree of a key must be smaller and all keys in right 
    subtree must be greater. So a Binary Search Tree by definition has distinct keys and duplicates in binary 
    search tree are not allowed.
