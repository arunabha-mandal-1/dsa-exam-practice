BST creation : 
    Algorithm : 
        step1 : Take inputs of number of elements to be added.
        step2 : Run a for loop to take n values from the user and insert in at its correct position using insertion algorithm.

    Pseudoce : 
        void createBST(root, n)
            take n from user
            for 0<=i<n
                take 'value' from user
                insertion(root, value)
