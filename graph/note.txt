What is a grapgh?
-----------------
    Grpah is a non-linear data structure. A graph is a collection of nodes connected through edges.

Formal Defination of Graph:
---------------------------
    A graph G=(V,E) is a collection of vertices and edges connecting these vertices.

    ~ It is used to model path in a city, social network, website backlinks, internal employee network etc.
    ~ A vertex or node is one fundamental unit/entity of which graph are formed.
    ~ An edge is uniquely defined by its two endpoints.
    ~ Directed edge: One way connection(fb follow)
    ~ Undirected edge: Two way connection(fb friend)
    ~ Directed graph: All directed edge
    ~ Undirected graph: All undirected edges
    ~ A graph may consist directed and undirected edges togrther. But it's rare.

Indegree of Outdegree of node:
------------------------------
    Outdegree: Number of edges going out of the node.
    Indegree: Number of edges coming into the node.

Representations of graphs:
--------------------------
    (I)     Adjacency list: Mark the nodes with the list of its neighbours.
    (II)    Adjacency matrix: 1 for an edge between i and j, 0 otherwise.
    (III)   Edge set: Store the pair of nodes/vertices connected with an edge. E.g. {(0,1), (0,4), (1,4)}
    (IV)    Other implementations to represent a graph also exists. For example: Compact list representation, cost adjacency list, cost adjacency matrix.
                Edge set: 
                    Store the pair of nodes/vertices connected with an edge. E.g. {(0,1), (0,4), (1,4)}
                    It's not used that much bcz it makes algorithms inefficient.
                    It's human readable but little bit problematic for computers.

                Cost adjacency list:
                    Cost is also stored along with the links.

                Compact list representation:
                    The entire graph is stored in an one dimension array. There is another one named cost compact list representation where two arrays are maintained.
