Hashing:
--------
    Hashing in the data structure is a technique of mapping a large chunk of data into small tables using a hashing function.

There are different types of hashing. Few of them are 
    1. Division
    2. Mid Square
    3. Folding

Division: 
    This is the most commonly used method for hashing.
    In this method, we map a key 'k' into one the 'm' slots by taking the remainder of 'k divided by m' i.e. the hash function is h(k)=(k mod m).
    For example, if the hash table has size m=12 and the key is k=100, then h(k)=4

Mid Square:
    Mid-square hashing is a hashing technique in which unique keys are generated.
    In this technique, a seed value is taken and it is squared. Then, some digits from the middle are extracted.
    Example:
        take p=3271
        we have q digit address
        square(p)=10699441
        find mid digit, that is first '9'
        if q=3, address is 3 digits from first '9', that is '994'
        hashing done..

Folding:
    It breaks up a key value into precise segments that are added to form a hash value.
    Then it takes last q digits to form hash value.
    Example:
        take p=12345678
        take group of q=3 digits from the last
        sum(12+345+678)=1035
        hash value is last q digits, i.e. 035
        hashing done
